\section{Introduction}
For our project we implemented a basic Distributed Shared Memory system in user
space on top of Linux.  Using DSM, multiple PCs can work
on the same problem simultaneously, and the system make sure that the memory
stays in sync as if all the CPUs were on one machine simply running in separate
threads.
\section{Implementation}
In our implementation of shared memory, each page has a process designated as
its owner.  When other processes want to perform operations on this page of
memory, they will sometimes have to contact the owner to receive updates on the
state of that page.

Each page can exist in three different states: Invalid, Reading, or Writing
